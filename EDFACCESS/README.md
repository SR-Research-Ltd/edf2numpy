Module: EDFACCESSwrapper
========================

EDFACCESSwrapper This code wraps the functions and structures defined in
the EDFACCESS API C-based DLL into a python format. To utilize the code
one must first install the EyeLink Developers Kit:
https://www.sr-research.com/support/thread-13.html Once installed full
documentation of the EDFACCESS API functions and structures can be found
in the EDF Access C API user manual.pdf packaged with the API.
